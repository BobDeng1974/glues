///////////////////////////// Maintainer's Readme /////////////////////////////

This is a fork of the original GLU ES library created by Mike Gorchak at
https://code.google.com/p/glues/. This fork is maintained by Joshua Bodine.

To build, you must first have the OpenGL ES and SDL 2 libraries installed. If
you are cross-compiling or using a toolchain, you will need to set up that
environment first and possibly modify the build commands. The following
commands are used to build this library:

$ ./autogen.sh
$ ./configure
$ make
$ sudo make install

To use the library in your code, you can include the headers like this (after
including <GLES/gl.h>):

#define __USE_SDL_GLES__
#include <GLES/glu.h>

To check for the presence of headers and library files on a system from
configure.ac, you can do something like this:

OLD_CPPFLAGS="$CPPFLAGS"
CPPFLAGS="$CPPFLAGS -D__USE_SDL_GLES__"
AC_CHECK_HEADER([GLES/glu.h], [], [
	AC_MSG_ERROR([no OpenGL GLU ES headers were found])])
CPPFLAGS="$OLD_CPPFLAGS"
AC_CHECK_LIB([GLUES], [gluNewQuadric], [], [
	AC_MSG_ERROR([no OpenGL GLU ES library was found])], [-lGLESv1_CM])

Please report any bugs or issues on the GitHub project page at
https://github.com/macsforme/glues.

GLU ES (version 1.5)

This port is based on original GLU 1.3  and has  original libutil,  libtess and
and nurbs libraries.

Currently QNX 6.4.x native target builds and Win32 (for  PowerVR  OpenGL ES 1.1
emulator) are supported.

History:

1.5 - NURBS support has added. Updated  HTML  documentation  to  reflect  the
      changes. New tests were added for NURBS.
1.4 - miscellaneous non-critical  fixes,  HTML  documentation has been added.
      Support for PowerVR OpenGL ES 1.1 emulator for Win32 has been added.
1.3 - libtess and tesselation tests (QNX native and SDL 1.3) have been added.
1.2 - SDL 1.3 based tests were added.
1.1 - Removed some texture formats, which are not supported by OpenGL ES 1.x,
      added arrays manipulation to the quadric functions. Sphere flat shading
      fixes.  Disk texturing with inner radius more than 0.0f fixes.  Updated
      tests.
1.0 - Initial public release.
